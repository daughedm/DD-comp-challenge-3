# DD-comp-challenge-3
This was the third static comp challenge to help improve my HTML/CSS muscle. In this challenge I was asked to recreate a static comp and transform it into a responsive site. I was able to take some creative liberties along the lines of color, fonts, imagery but I was to leave the original struct and layout the same. Below you will find the original composition and below that you will find my recreation of it.
